\subsection{Checkstyle}\label{subsec:checkstyle}
Checkstyle is a static code analysis tool for Java that checks code against a configurable coding standard.
It mainly focuses on coding style and formatting issues, such as indentation, naming conventions, and Javadoc comments.\cite{checkstyle-docs}
Some key aspects of Checkstyle include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item\textbf{Highly configurable}: Checkstyle allows you to define your own coding standards and rules.
    \item\textbf{Simple and lightweight}: It is easy to integrate into build systems like Maven and Ant, as well as IDEs like IntelliJ and Eclipse.
    \item\textbf{Limited to Java}: Checkstyle is specifically designed for Java and does not support other programming languages.
\end{itemize}
