\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

We explored some open source tools that can be used as an alternative to SonarQube or as a supplement to it.
We found that Checkstyle and Error Prone are good alternatives to SonarQube's code quality and bug detection features.
Jenkins is a good alternative to GitHub Actions and GitLab CI/CD, and it can be used to integrate other tools into a CI/CD pipeline.
Gitleaks is a great tool for finding and preventing leaking secrets in a project's source code.
Dependency Check can be used when dependency checking is needed in a CI/CD pipeline, but otherwise it is redundant to modern build tools and IDEs.

So in conclusion, it is possible to create a modern CI/CD environment using only open source tools.
